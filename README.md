I am an artist and researcher exploring the frontiers of human-computer interaction. I specialize in turning the imaginary into the real using generative design, experience design and graphics/interaction programming.

I'm currently working at https://subconscious.network as an App Developer and at https://twopm.studio as Technical Director on [WizardChess](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1274210/WizardChess/).
