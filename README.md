Hi, I'm Ben Follington. I'm a multi-disciplinary designer, programmer and artist living in Brisbane, Australia. I make, think and write about cool user interfaces, generative art, video games and whatever else interests me.

My work combines abstract form, elegant user-focused design and technical sophistication. I am endlessly fascinated by human computer interaction how it can change the world for the better. I strive for straightforward code, delightful UX, clear thinking, rapid progress and microscopic attention to detail.

I will be open for freelance and contract work in 2023.

I have extensive experience with UI/UX engineering, design systems, gamedev, software architecture, API design, interactive visuals (webgl & canvas) and mentoring enthusiastic developers.
