I am an designer, engineer, game dev and artist exploring human-computer interaction. I specialize in turning the imaginary into the real. 

I use my extensive experience in procedural generation, audiovisual design, product design and HCI research to help people connect the dots.

I'm currently working with https://common.tools as a Founding Engineer and https://twopm.studio as Technical Director on [WizardChess](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1274210/WizardChess/).
