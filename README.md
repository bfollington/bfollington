I am an designer, engineer and artist exploring human-computer interaction. I specialize in turning the imaginary into the real using generative techniques, experience design and graphics/interaction programming.

I'm currently working with https://common.tools as a Researcher and https://twopm.studio as Technical Director on [WizardChess](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1274210/WizardChess/).
